🔍 Explanation
This query:

Retrieves the 10 countries with the highest number of total COVID-19 cases.
Uses MAX() to obtain the peak total cases and total deaths recorded for each country.
Calculates the death rate using (total_deaths / total_cases) * 100, showing how lethal the virus was in each country.
Orders the results in descending order of total cases, ensuring the most affected countries appear at the top.
📊 Insights
The United States, India, and Brazil rank among the top three countries with the highest reported cases, mainly due to large populations and extensive testing capacity.
Death rates vary significantly across countries, reflecting differences in healthcare quality, early intervention strategies, and vaccination rates.
